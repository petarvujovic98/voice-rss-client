# Voice RSS Client

## What is it?

It is a zero dependency [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) implementation of the [VoiceRSS SDK](http://www.voicerss.org/api/)

## Installation

You can install the package using [npm](https://npmjs.com/) or using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```shell
npm i voice-rss-client
```

***Note:*** Add `--save` if using npm version lower than 5.0.0

for newer versions of npm.

Or if using yarn

```shell
yarn add voice-rss-client
```

## Usage

You can import the library and use the `getSpeech` function as follows:

```javascript
// Like commonJS modules
const VoiceRSSClient = require("voice-rss-client");

VoiceRSSClient.getSpeech(...);

// or with destructuring
const { getSpeech } = require("voice-rss-client");

// Or using ECMAScript modules
import { getSpeech } from "voice-rss-client";
```

Then you can call the `getSpeech` function to send a request to VoiceRSS with a provided config object.

```javascript
// Using async/await
const speech = await getSpeech({ apiKey: "...", language: "en-us", text: "foo" });

// Using Promises
getSpeech({ apiKey: "...", language: "en-us", text: "foo" }).then(speech => {...});
```

The config object accepts all the options that are listed on the official [Voice RSS API docs](http://www.voicerss.org/api/),
and like on the API the config object provided needs to have at least the API Key, language and text specified.

The function returns a `base64` encoded string which represents the audio with which the server responded.

The config object accepts only the options listed on the official Voice RSS API docs and if you are using TypeScript
in your IDE provides autocompletion for the options available, as well as the language speakers according to the
selected language.
